# The Ruby Workshop
You already know you want to learn Ruby, but which approach works best for you? Whether you want to kick-start your career as a web developer, build advanced applications with minimum code, or reduce code-complexity using RubyGems, you’ll find that The Ruby Workshop is heavily geared towards getting you build-ready for the real world. A step-by-step approach to learning helps you develop and reinforce key skills in a way that feels engaging and rewarding, without dragging you down into long-running lectures on dry, underlying theory. We use real examples that lead to real results. 

As you progress through The Ruby Workshop, you’ll find key concepts broken down into convenient, individual sections. Designed to accommodate short reading sessions as well as intense, laser-focused study, you’ll find that the included step-by-step exercises and open-ended activities help you embed and reinforce what you’ve learned in a hands-on, practical context. With every chapter carefully designed to let you learn at your own pace, you get to decide how quickly you progress and how you fit learning within your schedule. 

Unlike many other introductory titles on Ruby, if you purchase the print edition of The Ruby Workshop, you’ll be able to redeem free access to instructor screencasts of all exercises and activities, as well as detailed assessment tests and progression tracking. The interactive edition is our premium learning experience, designed to help show you your progress and embed your learning so that it sticks with you for years to come. 

With its explicit focus on demonstrating how you can be successful with Ruby, The Ruby Workshop is ideal for those who want to get their hands dirty and learn by doing. Pick one up today, and we’ll help you get the job done.
